## Description
PySSA ('Python plugin for protein Sequence to Structure Analysis') is an open software project that 
aims to integrate PyMOL and ColabFold to enable the prediction and analysis of 
3D protein structures for the scientific end-user. 
PySSA allows the creation of managed and shareable projects with defined workflows for 
the prediction and analysis of protein structures, 
which can be conveniently carried out by scientists without 
any special computer skills or programming knowledge on their local computers. 
PySSA can help make protein structure prediction accessible for research and 
development in protein chemistry and molecular biology, and for teaching. <br>
In addition to the prediction and analysis capabilities, PySSA has a more user-friendly interface 
for interacting with PyMOL, such as creating high-quality ray-tracing images in a few clicks.

## Contents of this repository
### Sources
There are five different Python packages that contain functionality for specific aspects of the architecture. 

- _pyssa_ 
  - The package contains Python modules, Qt .ui files and cascading stylesheets.
- _application_process_
  - The package contains a Python module for the _ApplicationProcessManager_ class.
- _auxiliary_pymol_ 
  - The package contains Python modules for the communication and integration of _Auxiliary PyMOL_.
- _pyssa_colabfold_
  - The package contains a modified version of the [_batch.py_](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/colabfold/batch.py) module of the [ColabFold library](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold). Moreover, the package contains the colabfold_run.py  and the service.py module for managing the ColabFold microservice.
- _pyssa_pymol_
  - The package contains Python modules for the communication and integration of _User PyMOL_.

### Documentation
The <a href="https://github.com/zielesny/PySSA/tree/main/docs">"docs"</a> folder 
contains the end-user documentation in the form of markdown and HTML files. In addition, the
docs folder includes the subfolder <a href="https://github.com/zielesny/PySSA/tree/main/docs/api-reference">"api-reference"</a>, 
which holds a documentation of the source code
(automatically generated by [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/)) and the subfolder
<a href="https://github.com/zielesny/PySSA/tree/main/docs/dev-notes">"dev-notes"</a>, which contains development notes.

Use cases describing specific workflows can be found [here](TODO: Add reference to use cases here). 

### Assets
The <a href="https://github.com/zielesny/PySSA/tree/main/assets">"assets"</a> folder consists of
the subfolder <a href="https://github.com/zielesny/PySSA/tree/main/assets">"images"</a> which contains the PySSA logo.
If you are using PySSA for your own projects, you are welcome to give credit to PySSA by using the logo in your presentations, etc.

## Installation
PySSA is tested and available for Windows 10 and 11.
### Windows
For a convenient and user-friendly installation, the <a href="https://github.com/urban233/PySSAInstaller">"PySSA-Installer"</a> is available
(click <a href="https://github.com/urban233/PySSAInstaller">here</a> to
automatically download the installer .exe of the latest version).
Download the installer
executable, start, and follow the instructions to install the PySSA-Installer.
After that, open the installer and install each component (WSL2, LocalColabfold and PySSA)
one after the other.
To start PySSA, double-click the created shortcut on the desktop.
To uninstall PySSA, open the PySSA-Installer and uninstall the components which
should get removed.

To install PySSA in an offline environment the <a href="https://github.com/urban233/PySSACliInstaller">"PySSA-CLI-Installer"</a> can be used.
This is a command line tool that installs ColabFold and PySSA without an internet connection. 
The WSL2 with the default Ubuntu distribution needs to be setup beforehand. 
If all prerequisites are met, PySSA can then be installed with the help of the install.bat file.<br> 
To update PySSA it is necessary to uninstall and then install the component that gets updated.

### Source code
It is also possible to install PySSA without the help of the PySSA-Installer.
In order to install PySSA a WSL2 environment needs to be setup and a WSL2
distro with a LocalColabfold installation is necessary to be able to run
structure predictions.
Mamba can be used to create a conda environment with the dependencies PyQt5, NumPy,
Pandas, Matplotlib, Biopython and the open-source version of PyMOL.
