Welcome to the PyMOL Plugin!
=========================================================
This plugin combines the colab notebook from DeepMind's AlphaFold with the molecular visualization software PyMOL.

   This image shows a structure alignment of the BMP2 protein.

The prediction is done with DeepMind's Google Colab notebook.
The structure alignment is done with the align command from PyMOL and
the image is also taken with PyMOL. All tasks were done with this plugin.

*Warren's Philosophy*

   We have chosen a free and open-source approach for PyMOL because we believe this strategy will have the greatest positive impact on humanity.
   Visualization is key part of understanding the nature of life at the molecular level, and powerful visualization tools 
   need to be universally available to all students and scientists if we are to make rapid progress in biomedical research.
