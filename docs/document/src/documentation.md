# PySSA - Documentation

The Python-Plugin for Protein Sequence-to-Structure Analysis (PySSA), is a PyMOL plugin which comes as a bundle together with
the open-source version of PyMOL. Therefore, you do not need an existing PyMOL installation.
This plugin combines the local colabfold which is based on DeepMind's AlphaFold with the molecular visualization software PyMOL.
Besides the prediction capabilities, the plugin offers also a distance analysis for a protein pair and
makes PyMOL more accessible, due to a more intuitive user interface.
