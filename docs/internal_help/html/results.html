        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>
            Here you can see the results from a protein pair.
            <p>
                You can choose the protein pair using the combo box.

        <h2>RMSD in Ã…</h2>
        <p>
            It displays the root-mean squared deviation of the structure alignment.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Color (By RMSD)</h2>
        <p>
            Click to color the protein based on the RMSD value.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>No. of aligned residues</h2>
        <p>
            It displays the number of residues which were aligned during the structure alignment.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>View (Distance Plot)</h2>
        <p>
            Click to open the distance plot, which is a x-y plot of the residue pair no. and distances.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>View (Distance Histogram)</h2>
        <p>
            Click to open the distance histogram, which shows the frequency of certain distance intervals.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>View (Distance Table)</h2>
        <p>
            Click to open the distance table, which shows a detailed table of the analysis.
        </p>
