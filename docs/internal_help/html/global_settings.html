        <h2>Cycles (PyMOL)</h2>
        <p>
            It represents the highest possible quantity of cycles for rejecting outliers. 
			It is advisable to change the cycles value if amino acid distances above a certain cutoff should be excluded from the RMSD calculation and distance analysis.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Minimum value</h3>
        <p>
            The minimum cycle value is 0.
        </p>

        <h3>Maximum value</h3>
        <p>
            The maximum cycle value is 99.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Default value
        </h3>
        <p>
            The default cycle value is 0.
        </p>

        <h2>Cutoff (PyMOL)</h2>
        <p>
            It represents the cutoff threshold for rejecting outliers during sequence alignment. 
			The cutoff collaborates with the cycles to set a limit for excluding specific amino acid distances 
			from the calculation of RMSD (which also includes the sequence alignment) and the distance analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover the cutoff value is neglected unless the number of cycles are more than 0!
        </p>

        <h3>Minimun value</h3>
        <p>
            The minimum cutoff value is 0.00.
        </p>

        <h3>Maximum value</h3>
        <p>
            The maximum cutoff value is 99.99.
        </p>

        <h3>Default value</h3>
        <p>
            The default cutoff value is 1.00.
