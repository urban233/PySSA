        <h1>Multimer Prediction + Analysis</h1>
        <p>Here you can create a prediction + analysis job for multimer proteins. This combines the prediction with a structure analysis afterwards.</p>
        
        <h2>Prediction + Analysis Job</h2>
        <p>
            To create a prediction + analysis job, you have to first create prediction runs and then structure analysis runs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Prediction run</h3>
        <p>
            To create a prediction run, click on Add and type your protein name in the text box and add the sequences to your protein.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Analysis run</h3>
        <p>
            To create a structure analysis run, click on Go (To analysis setup). Then click on Add, and choose a protein for protein structure 1 and 2.
            After that, select the chain(s), first in protein structure 1 and then in 2.
            You have to select the same number of chains in both protein structures. Then click on Next, to add the run to the job.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Image creation</h3>
        <p>
            To enable the image creation, tick the checkbox Create ray-traced images (slow).
            IMPORTANT: The image creation can take a long time, depending on your job configuration.
            You can also create the images afterwards!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Start job</h3>
        <p>
            To start the prediction + analysis job, click on Start.
        </p>
