        <h1>Edit proteins of current project</h1>
        <p>
            This page is for assistance with editing a project.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Delete</h2>
        <p>
            To delete a protein structure, click on a protein name and on Delete.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Clean</h2>
        <p>
            To clean a protein structure, click on a protein name from the list.
            <p>
                Then you can either clean the selected one (Update current protein structure)
                or 
            </p>
            <p>
                create a duplicate and clean that one (Create new protein structure).
            </p>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Add</h2>
        <p>
            To add an existing protein to your project, click on the add button.
            <p>
                You can either type the PDB ID or choose an existing .pdb file in your filesystem, 
                by clicking on the add button.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use a protein from the PDB, you need to have an internet connection!
            </p>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Save</h2>
        <p>
            To Save a .pdb file click on the save button.
