        <h1>Structure Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            This page aims to assist in the creation of an analysis job.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Analysis Job</h2>
        <h3>Create</h3>
        <p>
            To create a structure analysis job, 
            you have to add at least one structure analysis run.
            <p>
                To create a structure analysis run, click on Add to configure the run.
            </p>
        </p>


        <h3>Select</h3>
        <p>
            First, you need to select for each combo box a protein structure you want to analyze.
            <p>
                After that, you select the chain(s) of protein structure 1 
                and then of protein structure 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                IMPORTANT: You must select as many chains in structure 2 as you selected in structure 1.
            </p>
            
        </p>

        <h3>Add</h3>
        <p>
            After that you added your structure analysis run to the list.
        </p>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
            Before you start, you can decide if during the analysis images should be created. 
            <p>
                To enable the image creation, tick the checkbox "Create ray-traced images" (slow).
            </p>
            <p>
                IMPORTANT: The image creation can take a long time, depending on your job configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also create the images afterwards!
