# PySSA - Help Center

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-    [__Project__](project/index.md)
    
    ---

    Every work done with PySSA is organized into a project.

-    [__Sequences__](sequences/index.md)
    
    ---

    PySSA can be used to store protein sequences. It is the first central object type.

-   [__Proteins__](proteins/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA works mainly with the protein object. It is the second central object type.

-   [__Protein Pairs__](protein_pairs/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA generates protein pairs if an analysis is conducted. It is the third central object type.

-   [__Protein Structure Prediction__](protein_structure_prediction/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA can predict the 3D structure of proteins based on the amino acid sequence with the help of ColabFold.

-   [__Protein Structure Analysis__](protein_structure_analysis/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA can analyze two protein structures. The analysis makes a structure alignment and calculates the distances of C-alpha atoms.

-   [__Results__](results/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA generates results during the analysis that can be evaluated to determine the quality of the structure prediction.

-   [__Hotspots__](hotspots/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA can be used to zoom into specific regions of a protein or protein pair.

-   [__Images__](images/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA can create high-quality images which can be ray-traced.

-   [__Settings__](settings/index.md)

    ---

    PySSA has configurations which can be changed in the settings.
