     - color atoms by element color.
     - change the background color.
     - show or hide hydrogen atoms.
     - display the selected protein chain as cartoon.
     - display the selected protein chain as sticks.
     - display the selected protein chain as ribbon.
     - display the selected protein chain as lines.
     - display the selected protein chain as spheres.
     - display the selected protein chain as dots.

## Getting Started
### Change the color of a protein chain
1. Select a protein from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Click on one of the colors in the color grid.

### Color the atoms of a protein chain by their element
1. Select a protein from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Choose a representation other than _Cartoon_ or _Ribbon_.
5. Click on **Color** besides _Atoms by Element_. (Click on **Reset** to return to the previous color.)

### Change the background color of the current session
1. Select a protein from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Toggle the _White Background_ button to _On_.

### Show or hide all hydrogen atoms of a protein chain
1. Select a protein from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Click on **Show** to display the hydrogen atoms. (Click on **Hide** to hide the hydrogen atoms again.)


## Details
- Cartoon and Ribbon representation cannot be used to color _Atoms by Element_.
- Every PyMOL session has a black background by default. The background can be changed to white using the toggle.
- **Show** always adds hydrogen atoms to the current active representations. This means that some representations may show hydrogen atoms while others may not.
