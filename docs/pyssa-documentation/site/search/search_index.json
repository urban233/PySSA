Therefore, you do not need an existing PyMOL installation. This plugin combines the local colabfold which is based on DeepMind's AlphaFold with the molecular visualization software PyMOL. Besides the prediction capabilities, the plugin offers also a distance analysis for a protein pair and makes PyMOL more accessible, due to a more intuitive user interface.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>PySSA ('Python plugin for protein Sequence to Structure Analysis') is an open software project that enables protein structure predictions and analysis on a local computer. The GUI-Plugin offers extensive graphical functions for visualising and evaluating the quality of structure prediction. In addition, it is possible to create high quality images of protein structures in a few clicks.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Until now, PySSA is tested and available for Windows 10 and 11.</p>"},{"location":"#windows","title":"Windows","text":"<p>For a convenient and user-friendly installation, the \"PySSA-Installer\" is available (click here to automatically download the installer .exe of the latest version). Download the installer executable, start, and follow the instructions to install the PySSA-Installer. After that, open the installer and install each component (WSL2, LocalColabfold and PySSA) one after the other. To start PySSA, double-click the created shortcut on the desktop. To uninstall PySSA, open the PySSA-Installer and uninstall the components which should get removed.</p>"},{"location":"#dependencies","title":"Dependencies","text":"<p>Managed by PySSA-Installer:</p> <ul> <li>Windows Subsystem for Linux 2<ul> <li>WSL2</li> <li>License: Microsoft Software License Terms</li> </ul> </li> <li>Colabfold<ul> <li>LocalColabfold</li> <li>License: MIT License</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mamba<ul> <li>License: BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License</li> </ul> </li> <li>PyQt5<ul> <li>License: GNU General Public License (GPL)</li> </ul> </li> <li>NumPy<ul> <li>License: BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License</li> </ul> </li> <li>Pandas<ul> <li>License: BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License</li> </ul> </li> <li>Matplotlib<ul> <li>License: Python Software Foundation License (PSF)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Biopython<ul> <li>License: BSD 3-Clause License</li> </ul> </li> <li>PyMOL Open-Source<ul> <li>License: BSD-like license</li> </ul> </li> <li>SQLite3<ul> <li>License: Public Domain</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>Authors: Martin Urban &amp; Hannah Kullik  Contact: martin.urban@studmail.w-hs.de &amp; hannah.kullik@studmail.w-hs.de </p> <p>Institute for Bioinformatics and Chemoinformatics  Westphalian University of Applied Sciences  Germany </p>"},{"location":"about/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>PySSA - Python plugin for protein Sequence to Structure Analysis Copyright (C) 2024 Martin Urban, Hannah Kullik (martin.urban@studmail.w-hs.de, hannah.kullik@studmail.w-hs.de)</p> <p>Source code is available at https://github.com/urban233/PySSA</p> <p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p> <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
