                <step>Import at least two protein structures that you want to compare.</step>
                <step>Under the *Analysis* menu, click on **Distance**.</step>
                <step>Click on **Add**.</step>
                <step>Choose a first protein structure from the tree.</step>
                <step>Click on **Next**.</step>
                <step>Select another protein structure from the tree.</step>
                <step>Click on **Add**.</step>

    <details>
        <item>During the distance analysis, PySSA automatically generates scenes for residue pairs where the distance exceeds the configured cutoff. The cutoff value can be specified in the settings.</item>
        <item>It is not possible to run another prediction or analysis while a distance analysis is running.</item>
        <item>You can perform a distance analysis once. If you need to repeat the analysis, delete the corresponding protein pair first.</item>
