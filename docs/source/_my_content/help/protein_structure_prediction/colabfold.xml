    <details>
        <item>During the structure prediction it is possible to work as normal.</item>
        <item>It is not possible to run another prediction or analysis while a structure prediction is running.</item>
        <item>The prediction runtime depends on sequence length, number of chains, number of proteins to predict, how much RAM can be used and how fast the CPU is.</item>
        <item>The prediction cannot use an external graphics card. It only runs on CPU.</item>
        <item>The prediction runtime can vary greatly from job to job depending on the job's setup.</item>
