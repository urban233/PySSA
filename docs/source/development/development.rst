Development
===========

TEA makes life easier for PyQt5 developers by providing a
high-level library for integrating async behavior into PyQt5 based applications.
We welcome new ideas for extending or improving TEA and async.
We also welcome issue reports and people who will try to solve them.

Please contribute not only to the code base but also to the documentation.
Developers know how much work it takes to create useful documentation.
