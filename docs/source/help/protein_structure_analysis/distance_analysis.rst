Distance Analysis
======================================================================

.. card:: Overview

     
            In this dialog you can ...

            - analyze the distance of a structure alignment of two protein structures.
        




Getting Started
---------------

Run a distance analysis with two imported proteins
**************************************************
1. Import at least two protein structures that you want to compare.
2. Under the _Analysis_ menu, click on **Distance**.
3. Click on **Add**.
4. Choose a first protein structure from the tree.
5. Click on **Next**.
6. Select another protein structure from the tree.
7. Click on **Add**.
8. Click on **Start**.



Details
-------
- During the distance analysis it is **not** possible to use PyMOL.
- Everything that does not require PyMOL can still be used normally.
- It is not possible to run another prediction or analysis while a distance analysis is running.
- You can perform a distance analysis once. If you need to repeat the analysis, delete the corresponding protein pair first.
