            With this dialog you can ...

            - checkout the RMSD value of the structure alignment.
            - checkout how many residues were aligned during the structure alignment.
            - color the protein pair based on the RMSD value.
            - export the distance data as .csv file.
            - open the _Distance Data Visualizer_.
        




Getting Started
---------------

Color protein pair by RMSD value
********************************
1. Select a protein pair from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein pair.
3. Under the _Results_ menu, click on **Summary**.
4. Choose **By RMSD** in the combobox besides _Color Protein Pair_.



Details
-------
- The total number of residues in the _Aligned Residues_ metric comes from the first protein.
- If the RMSD value is 0.0, then the _Distance Data Visualizer_ cannot be opened.
