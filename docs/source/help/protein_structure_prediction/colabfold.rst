ColabFold Prediction
======================================================================

.. card:: Overview

     
            In this dialog you can ...

            - predict monomeric or/and multimeric protein structures.
            - predict protein structures with subsequent distance analysis'.
        




Getting Started
---------------

Run a protein structure prediction
**********************************
1. Add or import at least one sequence.
2. Under the *Prediction* menu, click on **Monomer** or **Multimer** depending on the type of sequence.
3. Click on **Predict**.


Run a protein structure prediction with a subsequent distance analysis
**********************************************************************
1. Add or import at least one sequence.
2. Import a protein structure that you want to compare to the predicted structure.
3. Under the *Prediction* menu, click on **Monomer** or **Multimer** depending on the type of sequence.
4. Tick the checkbox besides *Add Analysis*.
5. Click on **Go**, to set up the analysis run.
6. Click on **Add**.
7. Choose a first protein structure from the tree.
8. Click on **Next**.
9. Select another protein structure from the tree.
10. Click on **Add**.
11. Click on **Start**.



Details
-------
- During the structure prediction it is possible to work as normal.
- It is not possible to run another prediction or analysis while a structure prediction is running.
- The prediction runtime depends on sequence length, number of chains, number of proteins to predict, how much RAM can be used and how fast the CPU is.
- The prediction cannot use an external graphics card. It only runs on CPU.
- The prediction runtime can vary greatly from job to job depending on the job's setup.
