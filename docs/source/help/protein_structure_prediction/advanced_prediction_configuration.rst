Details
-------
- ColabFold can use an AMBER force field for energy minimization.
- The default is that the prediction runs **with** AMBER force field.
- If the prediction fails due to an unknown error, it may be helpful to turn off the force field.
- ColabFold can use pdb files as template.
- The default is that ColabFold uses the pdb70 database.
- If the prediction fails due to an unknown error, it may be helpful to switch *None*.
