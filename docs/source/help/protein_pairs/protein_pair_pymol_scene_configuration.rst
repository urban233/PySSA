.. card:: Overview

     
            With the *Protein Pair PyMOL Scene Configuration* you can ...

            - change the color of the selected protein chain.
            - color atoms by element color.
            - change the background color.
            - show or hide hydrogen atoms.
            - display the selected protein chain as cartoon.
            - display the selected protein chain as sticks.
            - display the selected protein chain as ribbon.
            - display the selected protein chain as lines.
            - display the selected protein chain as spheres.
            - display the selected protein chain as dots.
            - display the selected protein chain as mesh.
            - display the selected protein chain as surface.
            - hide all representations.
        




Getting Started
---------------

Change the color of a protein chain
***********************************
1. Select a protein pair from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein pair.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Click on one of the colors in the color grid.


Color the atoms of a protein chain by their element
***************************************************
1. Select a protein pair from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein pair.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Choose a representation other than *Cartoon* or *Ribbon*.
5. Click on **Color** besides *Atoms by Element*. (Click on **Reset** to return to the previous color.)


Change the background color of the current session
**************************************************
1. Select a protein pair from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein pair.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Toggle the *White Background* button to *On*.


Show or hide all hydrogen atoms of a protein chain
**************************************************
1. Select a protein pair from the tree.
2. Click on :google_material-open_in_new_w200:, to load the pymol session of the selected protein pair.
3. Select a chain from the tree.
4. Click on **Show** to display the hydrogen atoms. (Click on **Hide** to hide the hydrogen atoms again.)



Details
-------
- Cartoon and Ribbon representation cannot be used to color *Atoms by Element*.
- Every PyMOL session has a black background by default. The background can be changed to white using the toggle.
- **Show** always adds hydrogen atoms to the current active representations. This means that some representations may show hydrogen atoms while others may not.
