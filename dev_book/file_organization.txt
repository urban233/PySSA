The PySSA plugin is installed in the C:\ProgramData\pyssa\plugin
directory.
However, the actual plugin is installed in
C:\ProgramData\pyssa\plugin\Miniconda3\envs\pyssa_colab\Lib\site-packages\pymol\pymol_path\data\startup\tmpPySSA.

Due to permission problems, the unix script files are relocated into the specific user directory.
The path for this is C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.pyssa\scripts\unix.
